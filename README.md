# Predicting Hamilton Depression Rating Scale from passive sensor data

## Steps
### Preprocessing and Feature generation
### Dimensionality reduction of survey features
### Predicting HDRS from a surrogate variable (survey data) and imputing HDRS for increasing the size of the dataset
### Predicting HDRS from passive data (phone sensors, E4 wearable wristbands)
